# MySqlPractice

This GitHub repository contains SQL files with multiple practical exercises (queries) that I have performed on various e-commerce databases.
The database design and initial data inserts are derived from the Code with Mose course, ensuring a solid foundation. 

The repository includes:

SQL Files:

Create_database: SQL file for creating the necessary database schema and for inserting initial data into the database.
Insert_more_customers: SQL file for inserting aditional data into the customers table.

I encourage you to explore the SQL files to understand the complexities of order categorization logic and the detailed database structure. 
This repository highlights my practical implementation of database management techniques learned during the course, demonstrated through a variety of queries. 
It features a collection of diverse queries, showcasing my adeptness in applying these concepts in practical, real-world situations.
